      <p>Hi, I'm Samuel. I focus on AI policy and safety. I study Mathematical and Scientific Computation at UC Davis, and I use my technical background to understand tech governance.</p>

      <p>I believe understanding the technical details is necessary to make effective policy. This is why I'm interested in making things from scratch, similar to Andrej Karpathy's <code>nanogpt</code>, and why I'm currently implementing AlphaGo to eventually explore scaling laws.</p>

      <p>This blog is where I dive into my core research questions. For example:</p>

      <h2 id="on-governance">On Governance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How can we build structures that actually keep AI companies accountable?</li>
        <li>How did the very people who set up mechanisms to guard against profit incentives end up removing those very safeguards?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="on-economics">On Economics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the real economic impacts of AI?</li>
        <li>What happens if the marginal cost of labor goes to zero?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="on-learning">On Learning</h2>
      <p>I'm also fascinated by the pedagogy of learning itself. I'm interested in how Mathacademy uses scaffolding and recall to teach math effectively. This leads me to other questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are good frames of reference for different orders of magnitude of energy?</li>
        <li>What is the role of AI-assisted writing, and what is the purpose of education when universities just categorically ban these tools?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <hr>

      <p>This blog is for tackling these questions and contributing to the conversation about AI. I'm always open to discussing this stuff, so feel free to send a message.</p>
