We are an informal reading group at UC Davis dedicated to reading, discussing, and building on Joe Carlsmith's AI and philosophy work.

## Why Joe Carlsmith

We believe that reacting to rigorous, foundational work is the best way to develop your own takes and research questions. His writing like ["Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?"](https://jc.gatspress.com/pdf/existential_risk_and_powerseeking_ai.pdf) and the ["How do we solve the alignment problem?"](https://joecarlsmith.com/2025/03/14/ai-for-ai-safety) series provide a taxonomy for thinking about the assumptions and difficulties of AI risk. Our goal through reading is to encourage contributing to the most important questions of our time.

## How it works

We are low-overhead, interactive, and built for busy schedules. 
- **Format:** We meet once every two weeks to discuss one essay or section.
- **60min Structure:**
    - First half to (re-)read the assigned text so we're all ready for discussion.
    - Second half of discussion to break down arguments, assumptions, and explore our own ideas.

## Reading list

We will tackle one post from the ["How do we solve the alignment problem"](https://joecarlsmith.com/2025/02/13/how-do-we-solve-the-alignment-problem) series in each bi-weekly meeting.

## Some open questions

- **What is "minimum viable alignment?"** Instead of trying to solve the entire future and get ethics perfectly, what is the minimum level of alignment needed to just get the benefits and avoid catastrophic failure?
- **Can safety even be represented as a scalar?** We talk about a "red line" for safety and "blue line" for capability. Is this a useful model? How do you actually evaluate safety as a single metric to know if you're "above the line?"
- **When is the right time to pause?** What specific level of AI capability, one that is just powerful enough to significantly help with safety research, would be the "sweet spot" to pause further capability scaling?

## Interested?

We are currently gathering our founding members for Fall 2025.

If you're a UC Davis student who wants to join, please add your name and email to our interest list. Once we have a core group, we'll send out a poll to schedule our first meeting.
