# About Me

Hi, I'm Samuel. I focus on AI policy and safety. I study Mathematical and Scientific Computation at UC Davis, and I use my technical background to understand tech governance.

I believe understanding the technical details is necessary to make effective policy. This is why I'm interested in making things from scratch, similar to Andrej Karpathy's `nanogpt`, and why I'm currently implementing AlphaGo to eventually explore scaling laws.

This blog is where I dive into my core research questions. For example:
- **On Governance:** How can we build structures that actually keep AI companies accountable? How did the very people who set up mechanisms to guard against profit incentives end up removing those very safeguards?
- **On Economics:** What are the real economic impacts of AI? What happens if the marginal cost of labor goes to zero?
- **On Learning:** I'm also fascinated by the pedagogy of learning itself. I'm interested in how Mathacademy uses scaffolding and recall to teach math effectively. This leads me to other questions:
    - What are good frames of reference for different orders of magnitude of energy?
    - What is the role of AI-assisted writing, and what is the purpose of education when universities just categorically ban these tools?
        
This blog is for tackling these questions and contributing to the conversation about AI. I'm always open to discussing this stuff, so feel free to send a message.
